Description: 
The Expensentry is a budget and expenditure manager which is based on user comfort and contains some of the essential features for any user to handle their expenses effortlessly and completely by just a few clicks on their devices. It is a c language program focused on easy user interface and simplicity without compromising necessary features.


Instructions : 
The program starts by showing their logo and asking the user for their monthly income and the budget they want to spend throughout the tenure of using the program.
* The user should input the monthly income 
* The user is then asked to input the budget they would like to spend 
* Once the user gives necessary information the program shows its index of processes that the user can do.
*  First is “ 1. Add expense”   - here the user can input the name of the expense in a Single Word  like groceries or shopping etc. Then the amount spent in that category is entered. Once entered the program automatically prints the successfully saved message along with the remaining budget summary briefly.
* Another important feature of the Add expense function is that in any case of a user writing the same category name under adding it as a different category the program automatically saves the input amount spent in that category under the previously saved category to reduce duplicate categories formed and helps reduce data redundancy (further explained in sample cases).
* Then “ 2. Edit Expense “ - this is a direct function where the user can directly edit the expense amount from a specific category. The new amount entered is directly added to the old amount and the user has flexibility to add or subtract the amount entered under that category name.
* “3. Display Budget and expenses” - This shows detailed information about the budget details and expenditure that the user has had along with Time Stamps to view complete history of the expenses.
* “ 4. Edit Budget” - In any case where the user is halfway through the monthly expenses and is using this program and wants to change either his monthly salary or budget then this is the function to perform that task.
* “ 5. Delete Expense” - This function enables the user to delete a category completely which automatically updates the budget by removing the amount in that category from total budget.
* “6. Exit “ - this function finally exits the program and clears everything waiting for a new month’s budget to be entered.
